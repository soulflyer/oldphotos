Photos
Display a collection of photos.
Can create many photo entries in the database at once. Upload the files to a subdirectory of images/photos. This subdirectory should contain another directory called thumbs containing thumbnails of all the photos in the directory. They should have the same base name as the full size files, ie thumbs/pic1.jpg and pic1.jpg.
